            <p>Arrow functions – a new feature introduced in ES6 – enable writing concise functions in JavaScript.While
                both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences
                between them, as discussed below.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-white">Why use template string?</h2>
            <p>String concatenation can be done using several different methods. The + operator and template literals
                are a couple of these methods. Template literals make it easier to embed variables into a string.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl text-white">var let constant</h2>
            <p class="my-2">let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a
                value.
                Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
                usually
                denoted by curly braces {}.
            </p>
            <p>

                var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a
                value.
                Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global
                variables are available throughout your entire code.

            </p>
            <p>

                const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
                can’t be
                reassigned.
                Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
                variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>
